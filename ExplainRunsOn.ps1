.SYNOPSIS
Provides an explanation of the `runs-on` key in GitHub Actions workflows.

.DESCRIPTION
The `runs-on` key specifies the type of virtual machine (VM) or environment
that a job will execute on in a GitHub Actions workflow. For example,
`ubuntu-latest` indicates that the job will run on the latest available
version of an Ubuntu-based Linux VM provided by GitHub.

Using `ubuntu-latest` ensures that workflows benefit from the most up-to-date
software, tools, and security patches available in the Ubuntu environment.
This is particularly useful for workflows that rely on Linux-based tools
or dependencies, as Ubuntu is a widely supported and stable Linux distribution.

GitHub regularly updates the `ubuntu-latest` image to point to the latest
long-term support (LTS) version of Ubuntu. However, the underlying environment
may change over time, potentially affecting compatibility with workflows.
If a specific version of Ubuntu is required, replace `ubuntu-latest` with
a specific version like `ubuntu-20.04` or `ubuntu-22.04`.
